# CSI2772 Final Project

Final project for the "Advanced programming concepts in C++" course <br>
Author: Jonathan Guillotte-Blouin <br>

We had to recreate the <a href="http://www.looneylabs.com/games/seven-dragons">Seven Dragons</a> game, at least a spinoff of it, in C++.<br>
My version can also save the current game and load a game previously saved.
